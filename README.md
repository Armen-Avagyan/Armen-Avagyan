Hello! I'm Armen Avagyan. I have been a Stata programmer since 2011 but am now branching into Python. Interested in Health Data Science and gaming.

Feel free to contact me through my website: 
http://www.armenavagyan.com/p/private.html 

To do list (loosely ordered by priority):
1. Write code to automatically unzip lots of files (for work)
2. Automate Slay the Spire daily description
3. Analyze Slay the Spire pathing with Wing Boots
4. Download all media associated with one Twitter account (still possible with API changes?)
5. Create own font (focusing on smushed characters)
6. Access Slay the Spire leaderboards
